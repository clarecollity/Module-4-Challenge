## Overview
This program allows the user to analyze the risk and return of four fund portfolios against the S&P 500. This is done by reading in the data from the correct cvs file(s) and finding the cumulative returns, sharpe ratios, variance, covariance, and betas of the portfolios. The data is then displayed using line graphs, box plots, and bar graphs to make it easier to read and understand. After analyzing the data, we can use it to determine the risk that each portfolio poses by how much it tends to deviate from the mean and how it compares to the S&P 500 over a rolling window.
